# batch-convert-to-cycles

This is a Python script that converts all .blend files in a given directory (and optionally its sub-directories) from 2.79 Blender Internal materials to Cycles Render materials. 

The path name, extension of the new file, and whether or not to recurse through the directory, are all options that can be specified in the script.

You can simply paste this into a text editor panel in Blender, make the adjustments, and then run the script.
